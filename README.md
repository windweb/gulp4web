# gulp4web

We use Gulp (Gulp is a task manager and project collector) to optimize web development.

We automate: 
- converting and connecting fonts. 
Automatically update page your browser. 
Collect several HTML files into one. 
We work with CSS preprocessors, such as SCSS and optimize them. 
Not only compresses images, but also converts them to modern WEBP format, and automatically connects the results to HTML and CSS files. Collect several JavaScript files into one, optimize and compress them and much more! So, do you want the same powerful Gulp? Fine, then click on "Star" and "Clone or download."
